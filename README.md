# inference-engine
## To-Do:
- [ ] Framework for instantiating a neural network
  - [ ] Definine weight arrays
  - [ ] Instantiate architecture from weight arrays
  - [ ] Define bias arrays
  - [ ] Integrate biases into model
  - [ ] Instantiate using both weights and biases
  - [ ] Define activation functions
  - [ ] Define forward-propagation function

## Nice to have:
- [ ] Adapt weight array to accept layers of different sizes
  - [ ] Use array of 2D arrays rather than one 3D array to store weights
- [ ] Adapd bias array to accept layers of different sizes
  - [ ] Use array of arrays rather than one 2D array to store biases
