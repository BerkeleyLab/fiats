# Overview
`inference-engine` is a Fortran 2018 library which facillitates the loading of neural network weight and bias arrays and the instantiation of _fixed-sized_ feed-forward neural networks, enabling the user to perform inference on data.

Since `inference-engine` is written in Fortran 2018, it is optimized for scientific applications which can benefit from the performance gains associated with the use of accelerated machine learning.
